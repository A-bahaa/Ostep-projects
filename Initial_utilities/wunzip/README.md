# Wunzip

Wunzip is a program that takes a zip file and decompresses it .

## Example
 consider you have a file with the following input: 
```
5a5b5c5a
```
the output will be as the following: 
```
aaaaabbbbbcccccaaaaa
```
## How to run and test your program ?

Open the terminal and compile your program by  `g++ wunzip.cpp -o wunzip -Wall -Werror` command  .

If you want to run `wunzip` on a file in your device use this command  `./wunzip file_name.txt` .

To run all test cases use `./test-wunzip.sh` command. Look at this [README](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects/blob/master/initial-utilities/wunzip/README.md) .
